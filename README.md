# Consumption_Portfolio_Stochastic_Volatility

We study an optimal consumption and investment problem under Epstein-Zin preferences in a stochastic volatility setting. Using a finite difference method, we numerically solve the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and analyze the impact of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) and return-volatility correlation on optimal strategies.
